# Contributing Guidelines

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

Pull Requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests if:

1. They are functional
2. They improve the tool and/or repository
3. They are easy to understand and check

## Any contributions you make will be under the GNU GPL License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's issues

We use GitHub issues to track bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/ItsLogic/Xbox-Achievement-Unlocker/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail and background

Great Bug Reports tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
- Be specific!
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
