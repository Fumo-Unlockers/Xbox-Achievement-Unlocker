## About Xbox Achievement Unlocker

There are numerous paid services offering tools or services to unlock a full game's achievements on your account. Xbox Achievement Unlocker is a free alternative that doesn't randomly add gamerscore from arbitrary games or charge you to unlock a game's achievements.

## How It Works

Xbox Achievement Unlocker uses code from memory.dll to extract the user's XAuth token from one of the Xbox app processes. This token is then used to make web requests to Xbox servers, pulling information on achievements and informing the server which of these achievements have been unlocked.

## Requirements

- [dotnet 7](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-7.0.11-windows-x64-installer)
- [New Xbox app](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/xbox/9MV0B5HZVK9Z)

## Features

- Extract XAuth from Xbox app
- Obtain a list of games from the user or any selected XUID
- Unlock Achievements for any Title Managed game
- Spoof time in any game
- Automatic updates
- Automatically spoof time in the currently viewed game
- Search TA and use the Xbox API to get the titleID for any game with a store page

## Screenshots
